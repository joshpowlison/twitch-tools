Development System: pick an update from three importance levels, so there's a massive update in each but updates are relatively quick to get out (essentially, so I'm making one easy, medium, and hard update instead of tackling all of the hard updates at once and slowing down update output)

- Post a new version on Itch after every stream updating these?

- Add my YouTube, website, and other links to the main page of Twitch Tools
- Put a link to these tools on my Twitch channel
- Put these Twitch Tools on Itch
- Create two more ViewerImpact items

General

- Track what your role is in channels you're tracking:
	- Are you a mod?
	- Are you a broadcaster?
	- Are you a subscriber?
	- Are you a follower?
	etc
- Track viewer data locally
	- Allow streamer to save notes on viewers to review
	- Add notes on strikes to viewers
- Add automodding capability
	- Put in block words and swears
	- Autoban people from a master ban list in all affiliated channels
- Add bot command abilities
	- Would be best if I could tie these in to JS functions somehow, letting people create commands for anything
		- I could have it so that it reads window[chatMessage] and checks for functions, allowing mods to run anything. That could go horrendously wrong, or be extremely powerful. I could also tag functions somehow so that only certain people can access them, and push off other functions to the side.

packages
- Each package contains the following:
	- index.php: the file that contains the packet files
	- browser-source.html: the source to put into Streamlabs
		- Contains all JS, HTML, and CSS needed; one self-contained file
	- save.json: a save file for all relevant package data
	- script.js
		- Listens for events run by the home page
	- styles.cs

VIEWERIMPACT

	- Add controls help log
	- Guard against multiple gift subscriptions blowing out eardrums (they'd all trigger at once)
	- Test Subscriptions
	- Test Bits cheers

PRIORITY TODO LIST:
	- Add "On End" feature that has a different effect for different options:
		- Stop: stop the animation and return to the start
		- Loop: restart the animation
		- Play Next: go play the next animation
		- Pause At End: pause the animation and freeze at the end
		- Start From Cursor: restart the animation from the cursor's last position
	- Set opacity outside of screen area, so that you can see what it looks with the image out of view or in view; user choice
	- Pull Channel Reward names to use? (might be annoying, if haven't created the Channel Reward yet)

	- On zoom in-out on webpage (ctrl+mouse wheel) don't adjust image size
	- Figure out why opacity won't go down to true 0; create a solution (might be as simple as making the minimum -.01 instead of just 0)
	- Layer Test: see how multiple sound; trigger multiple?
	- Set timeline width to set?; so that it takes up less space if it's shorter? Or would that be annoying?

	- Adjust audio level of clip from inside
	- Add support for .jpg, .svg, .gif, and video files as well
	
FEATURES TO GET FEEDBACK ON
	- "Random Animation" option to create a new randomized animation at the press of a button

/*
/// TODO:

- I can automatically add Heckle rewards to Twitch, based on what's in the folder; I can even update them if I want to

https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#get-custom-reward

- Have it let people know if there are errors with things

- Heckle bugs:
	- Let user know if they are using an invalid name (else, invisibly adjust the name to make it valid)
	- Don't let users adjust animation values while it's animating
	- Add in a help button that displays all of the controls
	- Make the first play of an animation work

PuppetShow

/* IDEAS:

- Use left and right analog sticks on controllers to move puppets up and down, as well as rotating them (perhaps also allow moving)
- Use left and right triggers to swap characters, or perhaps images (to make them angry, happy, etc)
- Add the ability to have floppy appendages (like arms, hair, etc)
- Add the ability to have multiple puppets to swap out
- When move up or down, move the puppets' transform origins- it'd look a little more dynamic when they move up (like they're excited or emotional), and less so when they go down (like they're hiding or afraid)
