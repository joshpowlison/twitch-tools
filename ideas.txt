Development System: pick an update from three importance levels, so there's a massive update in each but updates are relatively quick to get out (essentially, so I'm making one easy, medium, and hard update instead of tackling all of the hard updates at once and slowing down update output)

Every stream, tackle one from each category below:

BIG UPDATES:
	GENERAL
		- Track viewer data locally
			- Allow streamer to save notes on viewers to review
			- Add notes on strikes to viewers
		- Add automodding capability
			- Put in block words and swears
			- Autoban people from a master ban list in all affiliated channels
		- Add bot command abilities
			- Would be best if I could tie these in to JS functions somehow, letting people create commands for anything
				- I could have it so that it reads window[chatMessage] and checks for functions, allowing mods to run anything. That could go horrendously wrong, or be extremely powerful. I could also tag functions somehow so that only certain people can access them, and push off other functions to the side.
		- Track what your role is in channels you're tracking:
			- Are you a mod?
			- Are you a broadcaster?
			- Are you a subscriber?
			- Are you a follower?
			etc
	RPSTREAM
		- Make the code good instead of atrocious
	CHATTRACTIVE
		- Display chat messages in a visually appealing way
	PUPPETSHOW
		- Pass input data to browser source
		- Use left and right analog sticks on controllers to move puppets up and down, as well as rotating them (perhaps also allow moving)
		- Use left and right triggers to swap characters, or perhaps images (to make them angry, happy, etc)
		- Add the ability to have floppy appendages (like arms, hair, etc)
		- Add the ability to have multiple puppets to swap out
		- When move up or down, move the puppets' transform origins- it'd look a little more dynamic when they move up (like they're excited or emotional), and less so when they go down (like they're hiding or afraid)
	VIEWERIMPACT
		- I can automatically add Heckle rewards to Twitch, based on what's in the folder; I can even update them if I want to https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#get-custom-reward
		- Have it let people know if there are errors with things
		- Let user know if they are using an invalid name (else, invisibly adjust the name to make it valid)
		- Make the first play of an animation work
		- Adjust audio level of clip from inside
		- Add support for .jpg, .svg, .gif, and video files as well
		- IDEA: "Random Animation" option to create a new randomized animation at the press of a button
		- Layer Test: see how multiple sound; trigger multiple?
		- Set timeline width to set?; so that it takes up less space if it's shorter? Or would that be annoying?
		- Figure out why opacity won't go down to true 0; create a solution (might be as simple as making the minimum -.01 instead of just 0)
		- On zoom in-out on webpage (ctrl+mouse wheel) don't adjust image size
		- Pull Channel Reward names to use? (might be annoying, if haven't created the Channel Reward yet)
		- Set opacity outside of screen area, so that you can see what it looks with the image out of view or in view; user choice
		- Add "On End" feature that has a different effect for different options:
			- Stop: stop the animation and return to the start
			- Loop: restart the animation
			- Play Next: go play the next animation
			- Pause At End: pause the animation and freeze at the end
			- Start From Cursor: restart the animation from the cursor's last position

MEDIUM UPDATES:
	GENERAL
		- Update Readme
		- Save general settings to autoload, such as which packages were open to auto re-open them in the same order
	VIEWERIMPACT
		- Add controls help log
		- Guard against multiple gift subscriptions blowing out eardrums (they'd all trigger at once)
		- Test Subscriptions
		- Test Bits cheers
		- Don't let users adjust animation values while it's animating
		- Add in a help button that displays all of the controls
	RPSTREAM
		- Make it more visually appealing
		- Allow pausing the countdown
	CHATTRACTIVE
		- Add way to clear the stream
		- If someone is banned, blocked, etc from the stream, delete their messages

QUICK UPDATES:
	GENERAL
		- Put a link to these tools on my Twitch channel
	CHATTRACTIVE
		- Highlight highlighted messages



- Post a new version on Itch after every stream updating these?

SLOWLY MOVE FEATURES FROM MY STREAM INTO THIS TOOLSET
	- Customizability is key; having different settings for myself besides the defaults (which also need to look good) is also key.

// STRUCTURE
packages
- Each package contains the following:
	- index.php: the file that contains the packet files
	- browser-source.html: the source to put into Streamlabs
		- Contains all JS, HTML, and CSS needed; one self-contained file
	- save.json: a save file for all relevant package data
	- script.js
		- Listens for events run by the home page
	- styles.cs
