- Track what your role is in channels you're tracking:
	- Are you a mod?
	- Are you a broadcaster?
	- Are you a subscriber?
	- Are you a follower?
	etc
- Track viewer data locally
	- Allow streamer to save notes on viewers to review
	- Add notes on strikes to viewers
- Add automodding capability
	- Put in block words and swears
	- Autoban people from a master ban list in all affiliated channels
- Add bot command abilities
	- Would be best if I could tie these in to JS functions somehow, letting people create commands for anything
		- I could have it so that it reads window[chatMessage] and checks for functions, allowing mods to run anything. That could go horrendously wrong, or be extremely powerful. I could also tag functions somehow so that only certain people can access them, and push off other functions to the side.

packages
- Each package contains the following:
	- index.php: the file that contains the packet files
	- browser-source.html: the source to put into Streamlabs
		- Contains all JS, HTML, and CSS needed; one self-contained file
	- save.json: a save file for all relevant package data
	- script.js
		- Listens for events run by the home page
	- styles.cs

TO DO:
	X- Make it so that ViewerImpact ends on closing
	- Perhaps add on "OnClosing" function?
	- Perhaps add on "OnStarting" function?
	- Make it so that save files are separate from package updates
		- So that the player can easily update the packages with no concerns about save data being lost
	- Don't let Test Browser Source links open up the same thing in a new window
