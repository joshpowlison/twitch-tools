Development System: pick an update from three importance levels, so there's a massive update in each but updates are relatively quick to get out (essentially, so I'm making one easy, medium, and hard update instead of tackling all of the hard updates at once and slowing down update output)

Every stream, tackle one group from below:

///////////

Big Update		: PUPPETSHOW Add the ability to have floppy appendages (like arms, hair, etc)
Medium Update	: PUPPETSHOW Add ability to swap characters (with images, and inputs)
Quick Update	: PUPPETSHOW Add input to flip a puppet (press Alt)

///////////

Big Update		: VIEWERIMPACT Add support for .jpg, .svg, .gif, and video files as well
Medium Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Guard against multiple gift subscriptions blowing out eardrums (they'd all trigger at once)
Quick Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Add controls help log on-app

///////////

Big Update		: GENERAL Hook into OBS or SLOBS PIPE and allow sending commands
Medium Update	: GENERAL Move admin panel settings into core folder and autosave/autoload previously loaded packages
Quick Update	: GENERAL Test Subscriptions and Bits cheers to be sure they're working (and if they're working with ViewerImpact)

///////////

Big Update		: RPSTREAM Code refactor for each use of
Medium Update	: RPSTREAM Make not visually appalling
Quick Update	: RPSTREAM Allow pausing the countdown between events

///////////

Big Update		: CHATTRACTIVE Increase visual appeal of default chat and limit number of messages displayed
Medium Update	: CHATTRACTIVE If someone is banned, blocked, etc from the stream, delete their messages
Quick Update	: CHATTRACTIVE Highlight highlighted messages

///////////

Big Update		: VIEWERIMPACT Adjust audio level of clip from inside
Medium Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Don't let users adjust animation values while animations are playing
Quick Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Let user know if they are using an invalid name (else, invisibly adjust the name to make it valid)

///////////

Big Update		: VIEWERIMPACT Try supporting multiple effect layers for an animation and see how it goes
Medium Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Figure out why opacity won't go down to true 0; create a solution (might be as simple as making the minimum -.01 instead of just 0)
Quick Update	: VIEWERIMPACT Make the first play of an animation work

///////////

Big Update		: WHOSINCHAT and ALLCHAT Combine into CHATWATCH, their functionality is similar and makes more sense together
Medium Update	: CHATWATCH Save notes on viewers
Quick Update	: CHATWATCH Display user roles in list (broadcast/mod, follower, subscriber, etc)

///////////

Big Update		: CHATWATCH Add automodding capabilities based on words and regex to watch for
Medium Update	: CHATWATCH If someone is banned from one channel, ban them from all channels
Quick Update	: CHATWATCH Allow mods to trigger functions in admin panel (I could have it so that it reads window[chatMessage] and checks for functions)

///////////

Big Update		: GENERAL Add support to watch multiple channels and adjust in settings
Medium Update	: CHATWATCH Display unique stats from all watched channels
Quick Update	: GENERAL Create Streamer Tools logo

///////////

Big Update		: JOURNAL Create on-screen journal that can be written in
Medium Update	: JOURNAL Include writing sounds
Quick Update	: JOURNAL Allow user to show/hide it








IDEAS:
	VIEWERIMPACT
		- Set timeline width to set?; so that it takes up less space if it's shorter? Or would that be annoying?
		- Support resolutions other than 1920x1080
		- Allow zooming in and out of timeline
		- Set opacity outside of screen area, so that you can see what it looks with the image out of view or in view; user choice
		- On zoom in-out on webpage (ctrl+mouse wheel) don't adjust image size
		- Add "On End" feature that has a different effect for different options:
			- Stop: stop the animation and return to the start
			- Loop: restart the animation
			- Play Next: go play the next animation
			- Pause At End: pause the animation and freeze at the end
			- Start From Cursor: restart the animation from the cursor's last position

SLOWLY MOVE FEATURES FROM MY STREAM INTO THIS TOOLSET
	- Customizability is key; having different settings for myself besides the defaults (which also need to look good) is also key.

// STRUCTURE
packages
- Each package contains the following:
	- index.php: the file that contains the packet files
	- browser-source.html: the source to put into Streamlabs
		- Contains all JS, HTML, and CSS needed; one self-contained file
	- save.json: a save file for all relevant package data
	- script.js
		- Listens for events run by the home page
	- styles.cs
