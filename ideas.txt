- Track what your role is in channels you're tracking:
	- Are you a mod?
	- Are you a broadcaster?
	- Are you a subscriber?
	- Are you a follower?
	etc
- Track viewer data locally
	- Allow streamer to save notes on viewers to review
	- Add notes on strikes to viewers
- Add automodding capability
	- Put in block words and swears
	- Autoban people from a master ban list in all affiliated channels
- Add bot command abilities
	- Would be best if I could tie these in to JS functions somehow, letting people create commands for anything
		- I could have it so that it reads window[chatMessage] and checks for functions, allowing mods to run anything. That could go horrendously wrong, or be extremely powerful. I could also tag functions somehow so that only certain people can access them, and push off other functions to the side.
